# Musk_Kaepernick
Tweets and X posts about Colin Kaepernick.

The dataset represents 11,353,489 observations on 14 features/variables and spans from May 24, 2018 to March 14, 2023. This means that the earlier majority of the data is during the platform known as Twitter and the later section is when it became X. 
The variables are (1) date of post creation, (2) username, (3) text of post, (4) user description, (5) user tweetcount, (6) user followercount, (7) user friendcount, (8) user favorites count, (9) Date of post simplified, (10) Date user was created simplified, (11) length of user time on platform in days, (12) sentimentr outcome, (13) AFINN sentiment outcome, and (14) merged sentiment of AFINN and sentimentr.

# FileNames
The files are listed based on the groupings of 250,000 posts. So, "Howard_Kaepernick1A" is the first 250,000 tweets of the first million (i.e., "1) and "Howard_Kapernick3C" would be the tweets 500,000 to 750,000 of the 3rd million of tweets. If a file end with a lowercase letter, it means that the dataframe was still too large to make it onto github--e.g., Howard_Kaepernick1Da are tweets from 750,000 to 820,00 and Howard_Kaepernick1Db are from 820,001 to 1,000,000. Most of the files (likely from Howard_Kaepernick3Aa onward) are set to exactly 125,000 observations. 

The data and files that are generated are freely available for public and academic use as long as the original work is cited as the source.
