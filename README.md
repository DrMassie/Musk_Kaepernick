# Musk_Kaepernick
Tweets and X posts about Colin Kaepernick

# FileNames
The files are listed based on the groupings of 250,000 posts. So, "Howard_Kaepernick1A" is the first 250,000 tweets of the first million (i.e., "1) and "Howard_Kapernick3C" would be the tweets 500,000 to 750,000 of the 3rd million of tweets. If a file end with a lowercase letter, it means that the dataframe was still too large to make it onto github--e.g., Howard_Kaepernick1Da are tweets from 750,000 to 820,00 and Howard_Kaepernick1Db are from 820,001 to 1,000,000.
